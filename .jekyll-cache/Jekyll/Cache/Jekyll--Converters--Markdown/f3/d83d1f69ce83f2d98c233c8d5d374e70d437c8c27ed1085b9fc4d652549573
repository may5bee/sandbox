<h2 id="energy-in-mornings">Energy in Mornings</h2>

<p>Bullet Coffee, combine:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Allgau-Grassfed-German-Butter-Unsalted/dp/B005TPJN7M/ref=sr_1_12_0o_wf?dchild=1&amp;keywords=grass+fed+butter&amp;qid=1624403784&amp;sr=8-12">Grass fed butter</a>)</li>

  <li>Your favorite black coffee</li>
</ul>

<p>For an energy boost (and sociable mood) to start the day.</p>

<p>High fat content within coffee means suppression of appetite (built-in intermittent fast, so over time you will lose weight) and mental clarity.</p>

<p>Fat content also forces the caffeine to disperse slower, so the “high” is smaller but it lasts longer</p>

<h2 id="actually-good-moisturizer">Actually Good Moisturizer</h2>

<p>Here’s a secret: coconut oil is an amazing moisturizer and hair protector.</p>

<p>Not actually a secret: coconut oil has been used for millenia to moisturize and even acts as a natural sunscreen.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="lots-of-greens">Lots of Greens</h2>

<p>Simply juice a full pound of a vegetable (examples: chlorella, kale, spinach, barley grass) You can add fruit for flavor but try to control the same fruit for every shake.</p>
