I"ä<p><b>Starchild</b> is a puzzle game for children about evaluating code. <a href="http://ianarawjo.therottingcartridge.com/">Ian</a> is building the game under Professor Gumbretiere, and Iâ€™ve been assisting by providing a narrative and game illustrations.</p>

<p>The story centers around Starchild, an alien hopping from planet to planet in search of their home.</p>

<p>Planets are themed by programming concepts - the physical appearance of a planetâ€™s resident is a pseudo- representation of that concept.</p>

<p>Levels teach players concepts bit by bit, untimately combining them.</p>

<p>Starchildâ€™s ship runs on stardust, obtained by completing levels.</p>
