<p>Working on procedural (code generated) cities:</p>

<p>The idea comes from Lindenmayer systems. L-systems were originally conceived as a mathematical theory of plant development.</p>

<p>So if plant growth can be modeled mathematically, why not architecture? Why not cities and megacities?</p>

<p>Considering the comfort we get from spending time in nature, doesnâ€™t modeling our cities after natural forms make sense?</p>

<p>Iâ€™m reading The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants, by Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz for reference. The text is made freely available by the author <a href="http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/abop/abop.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>The oculus world trade center PATH station opened last year. I get the feeling the appeal of it is that it reminds us of our own anatomy.</p>

<p>Vitruvius made man the measure of all things. His legendary <em>De architectura</em> associates architecture with the human bodyâ€” building as BODY, city as BODY, and the empire as the BODY of holy roman emperor Augustus.</p>

<p>The West is built upon the TAMING of nature by manâ€¦ Vitruvius is the descendant of a tradition that fetishizes the human ability to IMPOSE itself onto its surroundings - systems, organization, counting are nothing but machetes against a vast, dark jungle.</p>

<p>To grow up in the West is to take this for granted, much like joke of the fish that doesnâ€™t know what water is!</p>

<p>This conception is apotheosis of western thought, the reason for the great works it has produced, but also its limitation.</p>

<p>No such tradition exists in the east.</p>

<p>Just look to Japanese gardens to feel this difference, viscerally.</p>

<p>Tsutomu Nihei is an artist who conceives of a world in which building robots lose programmatic integrity (too many flipped bits?) over time, resulting in them building entirely random structures with no intended purpose in mind. Over time this results in unhindered, chaotic megastructures.</p>

<p>Scary? Yet, we are drawn for some reason to stories like that of Hong Kongâ€™s Kowloon walled city.</p>

<p>Cities that use NATURE as a starting point will ultimately foster a different conception of the world:</p>

<p>The acceptance of chaosâ€¦maybe the admittance that it is sublime.</p>

<p>Structures come out crystalline, primitive, subterranean.</p>
