<p>Working on procedural (code generated) cities, here’s what I’m going for.</p>

<p>The idea comes from Lindenmayer systems. L-systems were originally conceived as a mathematical theory of plant development. My (somewhat abstruse) reasoning goes: if plant growth can be modeled mathematically, why not architecture? Why not cities and megacities?</p>

<p>I’m reading The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants, by Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz for reference. The text is made freely available by the author <a href="http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/abop/abop.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>crystalline clusters used as both site, structure, and superstructure - this is an arbitrary decision borne out of an aesthetic desire for an organic built environment.</p>
