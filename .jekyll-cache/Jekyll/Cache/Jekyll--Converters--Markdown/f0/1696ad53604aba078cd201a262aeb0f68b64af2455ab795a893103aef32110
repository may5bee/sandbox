<p>Working on procedural (code generated) cities.</p>

<p>Like many things code generated, we start from Lindenmayer systems (L-systems).</p>

<p><img src="/sandbox/img/inbloom/lsystem.png" alt="Alt" /></p>

<p>L-systems are a mathematical theory of plant development by Aristed Lindenmayer, a Hugarian botanist.</p>

<p>If plant growth can be modeled mathematically, why not architecture…and by extension, districts, cities and megacities?…and by contaction, spaces and rooms?</p>

<p>Considering the comfort we get from spending time in nature, doesn’t modeling our cities after natural forms make sense?</p>

<p>And I don’t mean parametric architecture. Nobody likes that stuff.</p>

<p>Trying too hard.</p>

<p><img src="/sandbox/img/inbloom/oculus.jpeg" alt="Alt" /></p>

<p>(Here’s an exception. The oculus world trade center PATH station opened last year. It reminds me of: being in the belly of a big whale. That’s the simple appeal.)</p>

<p>Vitruvius made man the measure of all things. His <em>De architectura</em> associates architecture with the human body—building as BODY, city as BODY, and the empire as the BODY of holy roman emperor Augustus.</p>

<p>After the renaissance, the human body becomes the explicit starting point, the STRUCTURE for art.</p>

<p>But don’t be deceived! this vector started far earlier…think of plato’s city!…even the egyptians are fascinated by the measurements of the body.</p>

<p>The West is built upon the taming of nature by man… Vitruvius is the descendant of a tradition that fetishizes the human ability to IMPOSE itself onto its surroundings, very much in its own image.</p>

<p>To grow up in a eurocentric world is to take this for granted, much like joke of the fish that doesn’t know what water is!</p>

<p>Systems, organization, counting….our machetes against a vast, dark jungle.</p>

<p>These systems of organization are apotheosis of western thought and the source of its wonderful works, but also of its anxiety.</p>

<p>No such tradition exists in the east.</p>

<p>Just look to Japanese gardens to feel this difference, viscerally.</p>

<p><img src="/sandbox/img/inbloom/garden.jpeg" alt="Alt" /></p>

<p>And one might say I’m comparing apples to oranges, but imagine that one travels outside the USA, say in a small town next to the sea and is walking through the central plaza, under the dim soft lights and gentle evening chatter. What’s the difference? People will say things the cliches like “it’s more relaxed” and “people are livelier”, not realizing that the THRUST OF LIFE starts from a different understanding.</p>

<p>Anyways, what were we talking about? Ah, dark jungles.</p>

<p>Tsutomu Nihei is an artist who conceives of a world in which building robots lose data integrity over time, resulting in them building entirely random structures with no intended purpose in mind. Over time this results in unhindered, chaotic megastructures.</p>

<p><img src="/sandbox/img/inbloom/blame.jpeg" alt="Alt" /></p>

<p>Wonderful, no?</p>

<p>And to look at an example in real life:</p>

<p>“The Kowloon Walled City in Hong Kong was once the most densely populated place on earth, a teeming hive of interlinking high-rises that few dared to enter buy 33,000 people called home. Demolished two decades ago, the virtually lawless labyrinth still lives on in movies, books and even a Japanese theme park”</p>

<p><img src="/sandbox/img/inbloom/kowloon.jpeg" alt="Alt" /></p>

<p>“Caught between China and the British-run Hong Kong government, the city was essentially lawless, equally known for its opium dens and organized crime as its dentists’ offices.” - WSJ</p>

<p>“There was no law to speak of. This was an anarchist society, self-regulating and self-determining. It was a colony within a colony, a city within a city, a tiny block of territory at once contested and neglected. It was known as Kowloon Walled City. But locals called it something else. Hak Nam—the City of Darkness.” -atlasobscura</p>

<p>No place has captured popular imagination in quite the way that Kowloon has.</p>

<p>The seediness, the chaos, it seems like a jungle that self-perpetuates with no plan or guidelines.</p>

<p>What do PLANT LIKE CITIES look like? Let’s try to get away from code ideas, nerd ideas, the need for FUTURISM.</p>

<p>Is a sort of PRIMITISM possible based on a very simple, plant understanding of the world?</p>

<p>We’re talking about the acceptance of chaos…maybe the admittance that it is sublime.</p>
