I"Æ<p>The problem with health products/methodologies is that most of them are useless. Hype and insecurity are the two pillars of the industry.</p>

<p>I say get the essentials down and on autopilot. Then have your amazing health as well as the time to make the most of it.</p>

<h2 id="archevore-diet">Archevore Diet</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúAn Archevore is someone who eats based on essential principles, and also someone who hungers for essential principles. Take your pick.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In-line with the spirit of this post, we start with a diet based on principles that are aimed towards optimal health. Many find this diet EXCELLENT at improving fat loss without any calorie counting.</p>

<p>Rules of thumb: Animal products good. Real whole foods only: kill it or dig it up with a stick.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Plenty of sleep and get rid of non-food addictions</li>
  <li>Eliminate sugar and any drink with calories</li>
  <li>Eliminate gluten grains and wheat flour - that‚Äôs cake, cookies, bread and pasta. White rice is okay.</li>
  <li>Avoid seed oils like soybean (what we know as ‚ÄúVegetable oil‚Äù in the USA), corn, soybean, canola, palm, sunflower. Replace with pastured butter, animal fats, ghee or coconut oil.</li>
  <li>2-3 meals a day.</li>
  <li>Eat whole foods from animals (protein and dairy). Choose grass-fed red meats, these have lower omega-6/omega-3 ratios which is a good thing.</li>
  <li>Eat fish a few times a week. Eggs if you like them. Beef liver once every 1-2 weeks.</li>
  <li>Animal fats and starchy plant organs (potatoes, sweet potatoes, plantains) are excellent fuel.</li>
  <li>Get enough Vitamin D. Sun every day or supplementation.</li>
  <li>Exercise - resistance and aerobic are both helpful. Hormesis is the body‚Äôs favorable response to stressors. The rest days are where you get the benefits.</li>
  <li>Fruit is optional. Eat reasonable quantities, not too much.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="bullet-coffee">Bullet Coffee</h2>

<p>Does bullet coffee actually work? You know, consuming your coffee with some fat in it?</p>

<p>Bullet Coffee, combine:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Allgau-Grassfed-German-Butter-Unsalted/dp/B005TPJN7M/ref=sr_1_12_0o_wf?dchild=1&amp;keywords=grass+fed+butter&amp;qid=1624403784&amp;sr=8-12">Grass fed butter</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Laird-Superfood-Original-Functional-Mushrooms/dp/B07YXGDMHG/ref=sr_1_5?crid=1JRXQC5NLNNC8&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=laird+superfood+creamer&amp;qid=1624403841&amp;sprefix=laird+s%2Caps%2C242&amp;sr=8-5">Laird Hamilton super food creamer</a></li>
  <li>black coffee</li>
</ul>

<p>For an energy boost (and sociable mood) to start the day.</p>

<p>High fat content within coffee means suppression of appetite (built-in intermittent fast, so over time you will lose weight‚Ä¶do be mindful of the calories though)</p>

<p>Fat content also forces the caffeine to disperse slower, so the ‚Äúhigh‚Äù is smaller but it lasts longer</p>

<h2 id="actually-good-moisturizer">Actually Good Moisturizer</h2>

<p>Here‚Äôs a secret: coconut oil is an amazing moisturizer and hair protector.</p>

<p>Not actually a secret. Coconut oil has been used for millenia to moisturize and even acts as a natural sunscreen.</p>

<p>For hair, the idea is to use a small size (like a dime) and massage it through the hair and scalp.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/BRONNERS-Organic-Whole-Kernel-Coconut/dp/B00MN2T2OS/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=dr+bronner+coconut+oil&amp;qid=1624403903&amp;sr=8-1">Dr Bonner‚Äôs coconut oil</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="lots-of-greens">Lots of Greens</h2>

<p>Juice a full pound of a vegetable (examples: chlorella, kale, spinach, barley grass, wheatgrass, brocolli, swiss chard) You can add fruit for flavor but try to control the same fruit for every shake.</p>

<p>You‚Äôll find out over time which vegetables work best for your body because you can actually FEEL the difference in energy levels. Idea is to experiment here: finding a vegetable that your body works well with is worth its weight in gold!</p>

<h2 id="mental-clarity">Mental Clarity</h2>

<p>Don‚Äôt spend too much time down nootropics rabbithole. Try a mushroom combo from an established brand:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<h2 id="better-sleep">Better Sleep</h2>

<p>If still having sleep problems after sleep hygiene is fixed:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/NOW-Supplements-5-HTP-100-Capsules/dp/B0013OQI1W/ref=sr_1_6?crid=2XMPLPKKUXWVV&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=5htp&amp;qid=1624403963&amp;rdc=1&amp;sprefix=5htp%2Caps%2C242&amp;sr=8-6">5-HTP, an animo acid </a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="computational-kindness">Computational Kindness</h2>

<p>At work and everybody‚Äôs wondering where to eat lunch?</p>

<p>Make the decision. Just put anything out there.</p>

<p>People will subconsciously be thankful, even if they don‚Äôt realize it.</p>

<p><a href="https://neilkakkar.com/computational-kindness.html">Best thing I read in 2019 and it‚Äôs short too</a></p>

<p>Extends far, far beyond lunch choice</p>
