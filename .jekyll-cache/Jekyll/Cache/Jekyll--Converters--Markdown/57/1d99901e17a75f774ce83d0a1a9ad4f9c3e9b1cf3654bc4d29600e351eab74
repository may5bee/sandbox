<p>BUT players will discover that the customers are impossibly slow. The turtles that come to your cafe take days in real time to enter, converse, order, eat, drink and pay.</p>

<p>When players realize that change will happen on a timescale far greater than their patience can accommodate, they have two options: wait, or see what else the game has to offer. Quiet observation of the environment and its guests reveal a world of nuance.</p>

<p>It becomes like trimming a bonsai tree. The experience is almost therapeutic.</p>
