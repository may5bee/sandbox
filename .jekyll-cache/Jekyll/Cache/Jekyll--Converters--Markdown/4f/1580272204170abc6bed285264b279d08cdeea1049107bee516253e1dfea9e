<p>Working on procedural (code generated) cities:</p>

<p>The idea comes from Lindenmayer systems. L-systems were originally conceived as a mathematical theory of plant development.</p>

<p>so if plant growth can be modeled mathematically, why not architecture? Why not cities and megacities?</p>

<p>considering the comfort we get from spending time in nature, doesn’t modeling our cities after natural forms make sense?</p>

<p>I’m reading The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants, by Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz for reference. The text is made freely available by the author <a href="http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/abop/abop.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>Structures come out crystalline, primitive, subterranean.</p>

<p>The oculus world trade center PATH station opened last year. I get the feeling we like it because it reminds us of our own anatomy.</p>
