<p>Working on procedural (code generated) cities.</p>

<p>Like many things code generated, we start from Lindenmayer systems (L-systems).</p>

<p><img src="/sandbox/img/inbloom/lsystem.png" alt="Alt" /></p>

<p>L-systems are a mathematical theory of plant development by Aristed Lindenmayer, a Hugarian botanist.</p>

<p>If plant growth can be modeled mathematically, why not architecture…and by extension, districts, cities and megacities?</p>

<p>and by contaction, spaces and rooms?</p>

<p>Considering the comfort we get from spending time in nature, doesn’t modeling our cities after natural forms make sense?</p>

<p>And I don’t mean parametric architecture. Nobody likes that stuff.</p>

  <p>here’s an exception though. The oculus world trade center PATH station opened last year. It reminds me of: being in the belly of a big whale. It’s nice!</p>

<p>WARNING: AUTISM COMMENCING==↓==STOP READING HERE TO STAY PRESENT============</p>

<p>So Vitruvius made man the measure of all things.</p>

<p>His <em>De architectura</em> associates architecture with the human body—building as BODY, city as BODY, and the empire as the BODY of holy roman emperor Augustus.</p>

<p>After the renaissance, the human body becomes an explicit starting point for art.</p>

<p>But don’t be deceived! this vector starts far FAR earlier. just think of plato’s city!…even the egyptians find it important to apply precision to images of the body, hence why all their human bodies look exactly the same.</p>

<p>The West is built upon the taming of nature by man… Vitruvius is the descendant of a tradition that fetishizes the human ability to IMPOSE itself onto its surroundings, ….to craft its surroundings IN ITS OWN IMAGE.</p>

<p>and to grow up in a eurocentric world is to take this for granted, much like joke of the fish that doesn’t know what water is!</p>

<p>Systems, organization, counting….our machetes against a vast, dark jungle.</p>

<p>These systems of organization are apotheosis of western thought and the source of its wonderful works, but also of its anxiety. Look no further than the titles of the self help section of the bookstore to understand this.</p>

<p>There is no such tradition in the east.</p>

<p>Examine Japanese gardens to feel this difference, viscerally.</p>

<p>And one might say I’m comparing apples to oranges, but let’s imagine that one travels outside the USA. Say in a small town next to the sea, and one is walking through the central plaza, under the dim soft lights and gentle patter evening conversation. Shining eyes see shining eyes across the street. There is a difference one can feel in their bones but what is it? People will say the cliches like “it’s more relaxed” and “people are livelier”, not realizing that the THRUST OF LIFE starts from a different place.</p>

<p>what were we talking about? Ah, dark jungles.</p>

<p>Tsutomu Nihei is an artist who conceives of a world in which building robots lose data integrity over time, resulting in them building entirely random structures with no intended purpose in mind. Over time this results in unhindered, chaotic megastructures.</p>

<p>Both scary and wonderful at the same time, no?</p>

<p>And to look at an example in real life:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The Kowloon Walled City in Hong Kong was once the most densely populated place on earth, a teeming hive of interlinking high-rises that few dared to enter buy 33,000 people called home. Demolished two decades ago, the virtually lawless labyrinth still lives on in movies, books and even a Japanese theme park” -Wall Street Journal</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/sandbox/img/inbloom/kowloon.jpeg" alt="Alt" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There was no law to speak of. This was an anarchist society, self-regulating and self-determining. It was a colony within a colony, a city within a city, a tiny block of territory at once contested and neglected. It was known as Kowloon Walled City. But locals called it something else. Hak Nam—the City of Darkness.” -Atlasobscura</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No place on earth has captured popular imagination in quite the way that Kowloon has.</p>

<p>The seediness, the chaos, it seems like a jungle indeed as it self-perpetuates with no goal or guidelines.</p>

<p>What do PLANT LIKE CITIES look like? Let’s try to get away from code ideas, nerd ideas, the need for FUTURISM.</p>

<p>We’re talking about the acceptance of chaos…maybe the admittance that it is the only sublime thing.</p>
