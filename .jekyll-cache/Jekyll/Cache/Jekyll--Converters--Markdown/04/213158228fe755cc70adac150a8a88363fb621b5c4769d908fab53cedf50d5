<p>Working on procedural (code generated) cities:</p>

<p>The idea comes from Lindenmayer systems. L-systems were originally conceived as a mathematical theory of plant development.</p>

<p>So if plant growth can be modeled mathematically, why not architecture? Why not cities and megacities?</p>

<p>Considering the comfort we get from spending time in nature, doesnâ€™t modeling our cities after natural forms make sense?</p>

<p>Iâ€™m reading The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants, by Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz for reference. The text is made freely available by the author <a href="http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/abop/abop.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>The oculus world trade center PATH station opened last year. I get the feeling the appeal of it is that it reminds us of our own anatomy.</p>

<p>Vitruvius made man the measure of all things. His legendary <em>De architectura</em> associates architecture with the human bodyâ€” building as BODY, city as BODY, and the empire as the BODY of holy roman emperor Augustus.</p>

<p>The West is built upon the TAMING of nature by manâ€¦ Vitruvius is the descendant of a tradition that fetishizes the human ability to IMPOSE itself onto its surroundings - systems, organization, counting are nothing but machetes against a vast, dark jungle.</p>

<p>To grow up in the West is to take this for granted, much like joke of the fish that doesnâ€™t know what water is!</p>

<p>This conception is apotheosis of western thought, the reason for the great works it has produced, but also its limitation.</p>

<p>No such tradition exists in the east.</p>

<p>Just look to Japanese gardens to feel this difference, viscerally.</p>

<p>Cities that use NATURE as a starting point will foster a different conception of the world.</p>

<p>Just look at fantasy artistsâ€™ portrayal of the world when they think of a people closer to the earthâ€¦</p>

<p>Structures come out crystalline, primitive, subterranean.</p>
