I"q<p>This is cool:</p>

<p>LEGOs lets blind people see. I can describe the Eiffel tower to a blind person, but he can form a much better image of it simply by feeling and building a lego set.</p>

<p>The fun is translated over as focus shifts from the visual to the tactile aspect of the LEGOs.</p>

<p>Matt Shifrin is a blind high school student, who in 2016 created a standard for blind and visually impaired people to build Lego sets.</p>

<p>My friend Sharon introduced me to Matt. I was impressed and we teamed up to bring Lego for the Blind to a greater audience.</p>
