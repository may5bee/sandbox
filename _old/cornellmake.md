The problem: Cornell University houses a huge number disciplines within its 7 undergraduate colleges. I've met talented, driven folks from every background imaginable. Despite this, I hear this question far too often:

I think there's both a structural and a social dimension to this issue. Because of the focused nature of many programs, interdisciplinary collaboration has never reached its full potential. I began to wonder if a tool could help students working on exciting projects find each other and work together. 

I collaborated with Justin Selig to build CornellMake as a reponse to this problem. Justin wrote the back-end, and I was responsible for front end design/development.

Research
-------

Interviewing students trying to get a variety of different projects off the ground , I found recurring problems students run into when looking for collaborators. The first was a lack of accountability. Many students recounted situations in which communication with potential collaborators started fine, but eventually fizzed out.

Another was the intentionality of the project. People hoping to work on academic projects have vastly different expectations than those wanting to build a startup, yet the line is blurred when all projects are posted to the same Facebook group. And there seems to be no space at all that accomodates projects for personal fulfillment.

I began thinking of how a system could address these frustrations:

Design Decisions
---------

* Organization of projects based upon intent, rather than discipline.
* Team profiles, as well as individual profiles can be accessed through search as well as through their corresponding projects.
* Unpublised projects must be approved by admin before they are submitted
