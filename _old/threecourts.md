Throughout the 30s, German-American architect Mies van der Rohe was preoccupied with a series of court-house designs. These designs had no client. Rather, they were explorations of space for its own sake.

This project looked at one of these designs extensively: the House with Three Courts. It examined the underlying systems which govern the design, extrapolating and tranforming these systems through a series of iterative models.
