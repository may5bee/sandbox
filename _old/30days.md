I'm fascinated by fractuals and computationally generated images in general. There's a tension in physical art between abstraction and representation, that computer art seems to simutaneously revolve and exascerbate.

I'm sure computer art was the reason I became interested in technology in the first place.

During one summer, I set out to make pictures with code, by trying something new every day for 30 days. Hilarity and heartbreak ensue. More heartbreak though.


##### Critters
My first attempt at mondeling random behavior. It's not very exciting because the elementary way I handle randomness:

##### Perlin critter
I discover perlin noise and its applications in "simulated randomness"

##### Paint
Reconstructing a painting app

##### Invaders
Inspired by the classic space invader fractual, originally done by . Each invader is a randomly generated 5x5 pixel grid, mirrored around the horixontal center. Controls adjust the pixel size of the invaders.

##### 3D territory

##### More 3D

##### Starfield
Dot position generated with Perlin noise.

##### Boids 
This one is straight out of Daniel Shiffman's book.

##### Game of Life
Every color is a species. As time goes to inifinity, either one species completely dominates or all species die out. Starting positions and colors are determined by a random seed.

##### Cottage in the woods
I have nothing to say about this one.

##### Never ending snake
Whenever I learn a new technology I make the snake game in it. Why not? It teaches me how to use that technology to display, keep state, and update. This happened to me in a dream (nightmare?) and I had to try it.

##### Total collision
Haha

##### Generated plants
plants are hard because of all the splines and curves involved.
