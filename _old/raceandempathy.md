The <b>Race and Empathy Project</b> is an art installation that aims to record and share the everyday stories of Cornellians that evoke racial empathy. 

When I was brought onto the project, the physical space had been constructed. Professors Loeckenhoff and Guimbretiere had created a spiral that contained an isolated inner chamber——somewhat inspired by the shape of the ear.

I was responsible for designing and developing the interactive software component.

The software would located in the innermost chamber. The primary functionality was outlined as follows:

- Retrieve and listen to existing stories
- Record one's own story, to be sent to a private archive 

Early test prototypes revealed a hesitancy to engage with the installation due to the personal nature of the content. My design goal from the beginning was to encourage sharing.

What we came up with was a much simplified interface, that is completely transparent in what happens to the recorded messages.

The final iteration took the form of a picture gallery, albeit one where each picture could be interacted with.

Later, as a web version was set up, comment responses were added. We found some people were much more willing to type that use their voices.

As we collected more responses, I set up an archive that allows for listening to audio and viewing text messages.

What happens next will be the interesting part. I'm thinking of how instead of a traditional grid gallery, we see something like a graph and nodes, presenting content and interactions. Something like:

The real reward of this project was being able to listen to the responses. Some of the responses were enthusiastic, others contentious, others raw and emotional. Some were joyful, others full of grief. All told——a testament to the emotive power of shared experience.
