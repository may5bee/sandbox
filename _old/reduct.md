<b>REDUCT</b> is a puzzle game for children about evaluating code. I was responsible for interaction and narrative design.

The narrative centers around the genderless Starchild, an alien searching for their home planet. Starchild's ship runs on stardust, obtained by completing levels. This way, Starchild can hop from planet to planet, helping the residents along the way.

GAMEPLAY 

Players discover behavior of language constructs through play by evaluating code snippets towards a goal.

Using evaluation rules that are learned over the course of the game, players enact a series of transformations. The goal in each level is to transform the set of expressions on the board to the set of expressions in the goal box.
