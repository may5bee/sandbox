### We know that the problem with health products/methodologies is that most of them are useless. 

### You're busy, and too smart to fall for bullshit. So, the best use of your time is to get the essentials down on autopilot, then forget about them. Then have your amazing health as well as the time to make the most of it.

## Archevore Diet

> "An Archevore is someone who eats based on essential principles, and also someone who hungers for essential principles. Take your pick."

In-line with the spirit of this post, we start with a diet based on PRINCIPLES that are aimed towards optimal health. 

Many find this diet EXCELLENT at improving fat loss without any calorie counting.

Rules of thumb: 
- Real whole foods only
- kill it or dig it up with a stick. 

1. Plenty of sleep and get rid of non-food addictions
2. Eliminate sugar and any drink with calories
3. Eliminate gluten grains and wheat flour - that's cake, cookies, bread and pasta. White rice is okay.
4. Avoid seed oils like soybean (what we know as "Vegetable oil" in the USA), corn, soybean, canola, palm, sunflower. Replace with pastured butter, animal fats, ghee or coconut oil.
5. Only need 2-3 meals a day.
6. Eat whole foods from animals (protein and dairy). Choose grass-fed red meats, these have lower omega-6/omega-3 ratios which is a good thing.
7. Eat fish a few times a week. Eggs if you like them (poach them, fast and good taste). Animal liver once every 1-2 weeks (most nutrient dense part of animal).
8. Animal fats and starchy plant organs (potatoes, sweet potatoes, plantains) are excellent fuel.
9. Get enough Vitamin D. Sun every day or supplementation.
10. Exercise - resistance and aerobic are both helpful. HORMESIS is the body's favorable response to stressors. The rest days are where you get the benefits.
11. Fruit is optional. Eat reasonable quantities, not too much.

I know many who have been eating this way for years, works out 1-2 times a week, doesn't spend time thinking about what to eat, and maintains a good physique year round.

This stuff seems common sense for many now, but many people wondering why they are depressed or anxious or stressed could start by examining their diet.

## Bullet Coffee for Long-Lasting Energy

Does bullet coffee actually work? You know, consuming your coffee with some fat in it?

Yes, but it's not a cheat code. The fat content forces the caffeine to disperse slower, so the "hit" you experience peaks lower but lasts longer, hence people swearing by bullet coffee for long-lasting energy.

Simplest version:
-  [Grass fed butter](https://www.amazon.com/Allgau-Grassfed-German-Butter-Unsalted/dp/B005TPJN7M/ref=sr_1_12_0o_wf?dchild=1&keywords=grass+fed+butter&qid=1624403784&sr=8-12)
- black coffee

High fat content within coffee means suppression of appetite. Some people report eating later in the day, and eventual weight loss.

## Important: Greens that pair with your genes

Juice a full POUND of a vegetable (examples: chlorella, kale, spinach, barley grass, wheatgrass, brocolli, swiss chard) You can add fruit for flavor but try to control the same fruit for every shake.

Drink in the morning and assess energy throughout the day.

You'll find out over time which vegetables work best for your body because you can actually FEEL the difference in energy levels. Idea is to experiment here: finding a vegetable that your body works well with is worth its weight in gold!

## Moisturizer

Here's a secret: coconut oil is an amazing moisturizer.

Not actually a secret. Coconut oil has been used for millenia to moisturize and even acts as a natural sunscreen.

## Computational Kindness 

This is an important one. AKA making decisions for groups of people.

Mini example: At work and everybody's wondering where to eat lunch.

Make the decision. Just put anything out there. 

People will subconsciously be thankful, even if they don't realize it. 

[Best thing I read in 2019 and it's short too](https://neilkakkar.com/computational-kindness.html)

Implementing this practice, you'll realize it extends far, far beyond lunch choice.

## Happy Feet

This is an odd one. It also works. This is a tip from Navarro's "what every body is saying"

The body language of our feet are the truest indicators of how we feel inside. This is because our ancient response to a dangerous situation had to start in our feet, if we decided to run away or fight!

Observe peoples' feet in public transit on a weekday compared to a weekend. On weekdays feet don't move. They are glued on the ground. Of course - people have to work and they don't want to! On the other hand, you'll be surprised at how many "happy feet" you see on weekends...feet will be tapping up and down, or dancing every which way! This is the natural behavior of feet when people are relaxed or excited.

The next time you are upset, frustrated, or sad try rapidly tapping your feet, or bouncing your heel on the ground up and down, as long as you can. You might realize how quickly your emotions can change! 

Even better - try this the next time you find yourself in a tense, confrontational situation. You will relax, and you can choose to disarm the situation with relative ease.

## Approval Seeking

This is important.

Take a quiet moment and ask whose approval you're seeking in the things that you do every day.

For me it was (and still is?) my dad's. 

I'd get frustrated when he didn't "acknowledge" that I had accomplished, or when I felt like he was lecturing me on a topic I knew more about.

The most interesting part of this was that I could have spent a lifetime carrying this frustration without knowing it. Just walking away from our conversations with a tiny feeling of resentment.

I think it's natural that a lot of our decisions are driven by need for approval. I've noticed some feel this more strongly towards their parents, some towards their peers.

But nobody can give us this approval the way we imagine it. Literally nobody.

For the best portrayal I've seen of this in art, watch [The Meyerwitz stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJ0Ld6kcQE)

Highly recommend breaking down "feelings of desire from approval from X" with a good friend or psych.

Or just something to think about.
