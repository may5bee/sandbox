Since you're here you might as well walk away with some new knowledge right?

Here are some goodies obtained from people wiser than I:

Everything here is tried and true:

## Energy in Mornings

Bullet Coffee, combine: 
-  [Grass fed butter](https://www.amazon.com/Allgau-Grassfed-German-Butter-Unsalted/dp/B005TPJN7M/ref=sr_1_12_0o_wf?dchild=1&keywords=grass+fed+butter&qid=1624403784&sr=8-12)
-  [Laird Hamilton super food creamer](https://www.amazon.com/Laird-Superfood-Original-Functional-Mushrooms/dp/B07YXGDMHG/ref=sr_1_5?crid=1JRXQC5NLNNC8&dchild=1&keywords=laird+superfood+creamer&qid=1624403841&sprefix=laird+s%2Caps%2C242&sr=8-5)
- black coffee

For an energy boost (and sociable mood) to start the day.

High fat content within coffee means suppression of appetite (built-in intermittent fast, so over time you will lose weight...do be mindful of the calories though)

Fat content also forces the caffeine to disperse slower, so the "high" is smaller but it lasts longer

## Actually Good Moisturizer

Here's a secret: coconut oil is an amazing moisturizer and hair protector.

Not actually a secret. Coconut oil has been used for millenia to moisturize and even acts as a natural sunscreen. 

For hair, the idea is to use a small size (like a dime) and massage it through the hair and scalp.

## Lots of Greens

Juice a full pound of a vegetable (examples: chlorella, kale, spinach, barley grass, wheatgrass, brocolli, swiss chard) You can add fruit for flavor but try to control the same fruit for every shake.

You'll find out over time which vegetables work best for your body because you can actually FEEL the difference in energy levels. Idea is to experiment here: finding a vegetable that your body works well with is worth its weight in gold!

## Mental Clarity

Don't spend too much time down nootropics rabbithole. Try a mushroom combo from an established brand:

-  [Genius mushrooms (Lion's mane, Cordyceps, Reishi)](https://www.amazon.com/Genius-Mushroom-Cordyceps-Nootropic-Supplement/dp/B078SJ9F5S/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=genius+mushrooms&qid=1624403933&sr=8-5)


## Better Sleep

If still having sleep problems after sleep hygiene is fixed:
- [5-HTP, an animo acid ](https://www.amazon.com/NOW-Supplements-5-HTP-100-Capsules/dp/B0013OQI1W/ref=sr_1_6?crid=2XMPLPKKUXWVV&dchild=1&keywords=5htp&qid=1624403963&rdc=1&sprefix=5htp%2Caps%2C242&sr=8-6)


## Computational Kindness 

At work and everybody's wondering where to eat lunch? 

Make the decision. Just put anything out there. 

People will subconsciously be thankful, even if they don't realize it.

Extends far, far beyond lunch choice
