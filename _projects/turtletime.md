On the surface, Turtle Time resembles every other business game: it features profits, unlockables, and upgrades.

BUT players will discover that the customers are impossibly slow. The turtles that come to your cafe take days in real time to enter, converse, order, pay, eat and drink.

When players realize that change will happen on a timescale far greater than their patience can accommodate, they have two options: wait, or see what else the game has to offer. Quiet observation of the environment and its guests reveal a hidden world.

It becomes like trimming a bonsai tree. The experience is almost therapeutic.
