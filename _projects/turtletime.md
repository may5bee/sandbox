Sweet Days Studios (Kelvin Jin and me) presents Turtle Time, a subversion of the restaurant and business game genres.

On the surface, Turtle Time resembles every other business game: it features profits, unlockables, and upgrades.

Players discover the twist when they realize the customers are impossibly slow. The turtles that come to your cafe take days in real time to enter the cafe, converse, order, eat, drink and pay.

Initially frustrating, Turtle Time evokes the question: what does progress look like when causal link with output is almost severed?

When players realize that change will happen on a timescale far greater than their patience can accommodate, they have two options: wait, or see what else the game has to offer. Quiet observation of the environment and its guests reveal a world of nuance.

The experience is almost therapeutic.
