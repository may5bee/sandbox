We present Turtle Time, a subversion of the restaurant and business game genres.

On the surface, Turtle Time resembles every other business game: it features profits, unlockables, and upgrades.

Players discover the twist when they realize the customers are impossibly slow. The turtles that come to your cafe take days in real time to enter the cafe, converse, order, and eat.

Initially frustrating, Turtle Time evokes the question: what does progress look like when severed from ideas of efficiency and output?

When players realize advancement is foolhardy, they are forced to either quit or explore what else the game has to offer. Quiet observation of the environment and its guests reveal a world of nuance.

The experience is almost therapeutic.

Turtle Time is being developed for mobile by Kelvin Jin, Christine Geeng and myself.
