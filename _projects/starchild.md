<b>Starchild</b> is a puzzle game for children about evaluating code. [Ian](http://ianarawjo.therottingcartridge.com/) is building the game under Professor Gumbretiere, and I've been assisting by providing a narrative and game illustrations.

The story centers around Starchild, an alien hopping from planet to planet in search of their home.

Planets are themed by programming concepts - the physical appearance of a planet's resident is a pseudo- representation of that concept.

Levels teach players concepts bit by bit, untimately combining them.

Starchild's ship runs on stardust, obtained by completing levels.
