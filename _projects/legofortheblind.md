This is cool:

LEGOs lets blind people see. I can describe the Eiffel tower to a blind person, but he can form a much better image of it simply by feeling and building a lego set.

The fun is translated over as focus shifts from the visual to the tactile aspect of the LEGOs.

Matt Shifrin is a blind high school student, who in 2016 created a standard for blind and visually impaired people to build Lego sets.

My friend Sharon introduced me to Matt. I was impressed and we teamed up to bring Lego for the Blind to a greater audience.
